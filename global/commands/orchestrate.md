# Orchestrate: Full AI-Dev Workflow Automation

Run a feature through 5 phases — Explore, Plan, Build, Review, Ship — with TDD, code review, and PR creation. Input: a feature request string. Output: merged PR (codebase) or committed changes (text repo). Supports manual checkpoints or autonomous Ralph mode with state-file resumability. Trigger on "orchestrate", "run the full workflow", "build this feature end to end", or any feature request that needs structured multi-phase delivery.

---

## What This Does

The `/orchestrate` command takes a feature request and runs it through structured phases — brainstorming, planning, building, reviewing, and shipping. In manual mode it pauses for your approval between each phase. In Ralph mode it runs end-to-end autonomously, resuming from where it left off after context resets.

It works for both **codebases** (apps with tests, builds, branches) and **text repos** (markdown, config, documentation).

---

## Prerequisites

- These plugins installed:
  - superpowers (brainstorming, TDD, plans, verification)
  - pr-review-toolkit (code review)
  - commit-commands (git workflow)
- These agents available (via `~/.claude/agents/` or the repo's `.claude/agents/`):
  - `security-review` — invoked in Phase 3 for sensitive-scope diffs. Missing agent → warn and skip, never silently proceed.
  - `technical-writer` — invoked in Phase 4.
- `gh` CLI authenticated (needed for the CI gate in Ship)
- Git repository initialized
- **For Ralph mode:** `ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official` enabled in `~/.claude/settings.json`

---

## Repo Type Detection

Before starting, determine the repo type. This affects branching and git workflow throughout.

```dot
digraph repo_type {
    "Has package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, or Makefile with build/test targets?" [shape=diamond];
    "Codebase" [shape=box];
    "Text repo" [shape=box];

    "Has package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, or Makefile with build/test targets?" -> "Codebase" [label="yes"];
    "Has package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pyproject.toml, or Makefile with build/test targets?" -> "Text repo" [label="no"];
}
```

**Codebase:** Has build tools, test runners, compiled output. Needs feature branches, PRs, test gates.

**Text repo:** Markdown, config, prompts, docs. Commits to main, no PR needed unless requested.

Store the result — every later phase checks it.

---

## Session Setup

### Step 1: Check for existing state

Look for `.claude/orchestrate.local.md` in the repo root.

If found:
> "Found in-progress `/orchestrate` session (Phase {N} — {phase name}). Resume where you left off? (y/n)"

- **Yes:** Load state, jump to the in-progress phase.
- **No:** Delete the state file, start fresh.

If not found, continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Choose execution mode

> "Run autonomously (Ralph mode) or with approval checkpoints (manual)?"

- **Ralph:** Check that `ralph-loop@claude-plugins-official` is enabled in `~/.claude/settings.json`. If not, offer to enable it. Set mode to `ralph`.
- **Manual:** Set mode to `manual`. All checkpoints active — identical to the original workflow.

### Step 3: Write state file

Create `.claude/orchestrate.local.md`:

```markdown
---
mode: ralph | manual
feature: "{feature description}"
repo_type: pending
branch: pending
plan_path: pending
phase: setup
started: {ISO timestamp}
completion_promise: ORCHESTRATE_COMPLETE
---

## Progress

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Explore | pending |
| Plan | pending |
| Branch | pending |
| Build | pending |
| Review | pending |
| Document | pending |
| Ship | pending |
```

Add `.claude/orchestrate.local.md` to `.gitignore` if not already there — this is local session state, not committed.

---

## Standards Discovery

Look for project standards in this order (use the first found):

1. `CONSTITUTION.md` in repo root
2. `CLAUDE.md` in repo root
3. `AGENTS.md` in repo root
4. Infer from existing code patterns and tooling

Reference whichever is found as "project standards" throughout.

---

## Phase Execution

Read `references/orchestrate/phases.md` for detailed phase instructions. Summary:

| Phase | Skill Used | Gate (Manual) | Gate (Ralph) |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **0: Explore** | `superpowers:brainstorming` | "Does this capture what you want?" | Auto-pick strongest approach |
| **1: Plan** | `superpowers:writing-plans` | "Review the plan. Ready to build?" | Auto-continue |
| **1.5: Branch** | `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` | *(none — auto)* | *(none — auto)* |
| **2: Build** | `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` | "Implementation complete. Ready for review?" | Auto-continue |
| **3: Review** | `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` / `superpowers:requesting-code-review` + `security-review` agent (scope-gated) | "Review complete. Approve documentation?" | Auto-fix critical/high + all security Blockers |
| **4: Document** | `technical-writer` agent + `/wrap` | "Ready to ship?" | Auto-continue |
| **Ship** | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` + CI gate (`gh pr checks`) | Present all options; CI must be green | Auto-create PR; wait for CI green before `ORCHESTRATE_COMPLETE` |

Each phase updates the state file on entry (`in-progress`) and exit (`done`).

---

## User Interaction Points

**Manual mode** — you pause for approval at these checkpoints:

1. After brainstorming: "Does this capture what you want?"
2. After planning: "Review the plan. Ready to build?"
3. After building: "Implementation complete. Ready for review?"
4. After review: "Review complete. Approve documentation?"
5. After documentation: "Ready to ship?"

Between checkpoints, work autonomously. Only pause for approval, not micro-decisions.

**Ralph mode** — no checkpoints. Work autonomously from start to finish. The state file provides continuity across context resets.

---

## Ralph Loop Integration

### How it works

When Ralph mode is active:
- The state file persists across context resets
- Each new iteration reads the state file first
- Completed phases are skipped — jump to the first `in-progress` or `pending` phase
- The plan file, branch name, and repo type are all in the state file, so no context is lost
- `<promise>ORCHESTRATE_COMPLETE</promise>` is output only when Ship is done

### Safety

- Failed phases are not retried infinitely — if a phase fails twice, stop and report
- The state file is written to `.gitignore` — it's local session state, not committed
- Context pressure checks during Build phase prevent working with degraded context

## Usage

```
/orchestrate "Build user authentication with email and OAuth"
```

For full example runs (manual + Ralph mode), see `references/orchestrate/examples.md`.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Mode is a per-invocation choice** — Ralph or manual, chosen at the start, not auto-detected
2. **State-driven resumability** — State file enables multi-session work with or without Ralph
3. **Repo-type aware** — Codebases get branches + PRs; text repos commit to main
4. **Plugin-powered** — Each phase delegates to the best available plugin/skill
5. **Quality gates** — Review phase runs specialized checks, verification proves claims
6. **Learning capture** — Every session improves future orchestration via /wrap
7. **Security is scope-gated, not optional** — Diffs touching auth, APIs, RLS, env vars, MCP/skills/agents trigger the `security-review` agent. Missing agent → warn and skip, never silently proceed.
8. **Shipping waits for CI** — Ralph cannot declare completion while PR checks are pending or red.
